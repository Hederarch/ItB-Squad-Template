It's always annoying to make new squads due to having to put together all the boiler-plate setup. 

This eliminates that and provides a base to work from with all the setup taken care of.

This "mod" is a copy of the Rift Walkers built from Lemonymous' mech and weapon templates to allow for easy editing through lua.
Includes template files for mechs, weapons, and a custom default palette. More meant for editing than playing, gameplay-wise it is just the Rift Walkers.
